	<p>The course trains engineers to practice hydrologic and hydraulic modeling
        in one-dimensional unsteady conditiond; and in higher sparial dimensions (2D/3D) using 
        custom-written and professional software tools.
        Integration of simulation tools to examine complex systems is emphasized.
	<br/><br/>
	The course provides an experience in different modeling platforms(DIY, HEC-RAS, SWMM, EFDC) 	
	to answer hydrodynamic questions using non-trivial examples.<br/><br/>
	Upon successful completion of this course, the participant will have:<br>
        1. Review relevant theory for 1D dynamic wave routing. <br>
	2. Develop and code a Lax-Diffusion method for time-varying flow in an
           open channel and compared results with HEC-RAS unsteady and SWMM. 
        <br>
	3. Simulate the confluence of two streams in steady and unsteady conditions
         (fabricated conditions) using HEC-RAS or SWMM (1D-spatial)
        <br>
	4. Simulate the confluence of White Oak and Buffalo Bayou in steady and unsteady conditions
         using HEC-RAS or SWMM (1D-spatial)
         <br>
        5. Simulate a large-scale (county) drainage network <br> 
	6. Examine theory for 2D estuary/floodplain modeling 
        <br>
        7. Develop a quasi-2D model using SWMM
        8. Develop and code a diffusion approximation for 2D floodplain
        <br>
        9. Simulate selected examples using EFDC
        <br>
       &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a). Simulate 2D steady in East Lab Flume (real flume)
        <br>
       &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b). Simulate 2D steady White River
        <br> 
       &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp c). Simulate 2D unsteady "simple estuary" with river inflow
        <br>
       &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp d). Simulate 2D unsteady San Antonio Bay with salinity tracking

	Familarity with computer programming (MatLab, Python, Excel-VBA, R) will be
