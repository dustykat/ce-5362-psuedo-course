    "In general, 1-D unsteady flow would be considered state-of-practice computation; every engineer would be expected to be able to make such calculations (using professional software). 2-D computation is becoming routine using general purpose software. 3-D computation as of this writing (circa 2009) is still in the realm of state-of-art, and may not be within the capability a typical consulting firm.\n",

    "The conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in the context of the cell balance method is used herein to develop the mathematical and computational structure. The cell balance is a computational structure that is somewhat analogous to the Reynolds transport theorem, except the end results are difference equations that can be updates to approximate physical processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The philosophy is a hybrid approach - instead of developing the differential equations first, then numerical approximations, the numerical constructs are built directly and the limiting process is employed to demonstrate that the constructs indeed mimic the differential equations that describe our current understanding of the physics."

    "The cell balance method envisions the world as representable by a computational cell (or more typically a collection of cells) with some finite dimension, fixed in space about a cell centroid. Some dimensions are changeable - such as depth.\n",

A computational cell can be called a reach, although in HEC-RAS a reach is a portion of a stream that may contain many cells; depth is computed at the centroid or at either end (software dependent), suffice to say here that our reality (Figure 1) is conceptualized into an abstraction (Figure 3) and we work on the abstraction to ask questions (of the model).\n"

    "\n",
    "The fundamental computational element is a computational cell or a reach. Some professional software, in particular HEC-RAS, considers a reach to be a specific portion of a river system that may be comprised of several computational sub-reaches (cells). The engineer will need to consider the context and the tool used to decide which way to describe their problem to the program (and to the client).\n",

    "$Q +\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\Delta x}{2}$. The direction is strictly a sign convention and the development does not require flow in a single direction. The topographic slope is $S_0$, assumed relatively constant in each reach, but can vary between reaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of the unsteady flow equations herein uses several assumptions:\n",
    "1. The pressure distribution at any section is hydrostatic ; this assumption allows computation of pressure force as a function of depth.\n",
    "2. Wavelengths are long relative to flow depth; use the shallow wave theory.\n",
    "3. Channel slopes are small enough so that the topographic slope is roughly equal to the tangent of the angle formed by the channel bottom and the horizontal.\n",
    "4. The flow is one-dimensional ; this assumption implies that longitudinal dimension is large relative to cross sectional dimension. Generally river flows will meet this assumption, it fails in estuaries where the spatial dimensions (length and width) are roughly equal. Thus rivers that are hundreds of feet wide imply that reaches are miles long. If this assumption cannot be met, then 2-D methods are more appropriate.'\n",
    "5. Friction is modeled by Chezy-Manning type empirical models. The particular friction model does not really matter, but historically these equations have used the friction slope concept as computed from one of these empirical models.\n",
