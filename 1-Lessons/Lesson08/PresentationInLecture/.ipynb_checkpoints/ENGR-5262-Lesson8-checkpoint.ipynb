    "The backwater curve situation for a rectangular channel with discharge over a weir is repeated.  The channel width is 5 meters, bottom slope $0.001$, Manning's $n=0.02$ and discharge $Q=55.4 \\frac{m^3}{sec}$.\n",

    "We will build a transient solver, although this problem is a steady flow case that we can check with an independent tool (Hamming's approach a few lessons ago).  We will start with the flow depth artificially large and observe the transient solver evolve eventually produce an equilibrium solution that should be the same as the steady-flow solver.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally such a simulation is a good idea to test a new algorithm -- it should be stable enough to converge to and maintain a steady solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why we would consider a transient solver is to examine cases such as that depicted in Figure 1\n",

    "The script is comprised of several parts, and eventually for the sake of taking advantage of the ability to read and operate on files, the script will have several \"libraries\" that are read by a main control program.  \n",
