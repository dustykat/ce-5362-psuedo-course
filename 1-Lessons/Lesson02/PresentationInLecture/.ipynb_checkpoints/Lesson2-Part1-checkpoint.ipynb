The computational procedures are reasonably complex and typically beyond the limits of hand computation; computer programs are necessary and required for many computational hydraulics problems.\n",

    "### What is a Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many definitions, a few are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A model is a simplification of reality that duplicates the excitation-response of the real system but is faster, smaller, or more practical to study than the real system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A mathematical model is composed of mathematical expressions quantifying fundamental physical principles (force, energy, mass, etc.). These expressions are adapted and simplified in each case to the special features of the problem to be tackled.\n",
    "3. A model is any device that represents an approximation of a field situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several categories of models: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Physical models** such as laboratory sand tanks, flumes, pipe networks, porous columns, batch reactors, and pilot plants are used to directly simulate various conditions anticipated in full scale settings. Physical models tend to be the most costly to build from scratch, but many questions cannot be answered without these kind of model\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analog models** such as electric circuit analogs or Hele-Shaw analogs are used to indirectly simulate field conditions by direct simulation in a domain analogous to the real setting.  Analog computers are quite rare today, but in the 1960's were a principal tool in modeling and were used in aerospace as well as mundane civil engineering applications. A laboratory mouse used to test medicine doses (usually for lethality) is an example of an analog model for human testing. Bear (1972), Chapter 11 provides an excellent background on analog models. The treatment is mostly aimed at porous medium flow, but the concepts are generic. The book has some nice photographs of electric-analog computers (which are rare today).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mathematical models** indirectly simulate field conditions by solution of a governing equation thought to represent the system, along with auxiliary equations that describe the boundary and forcing conditions. These physics and chemical relationships are represented as sets of algebraic equations. Conversion from physics to the computer is via finite-difference, finite-element, finite-volume analysis. Particle tracking is an alternate approach. Mathematical models are solved analytically or numerically -- both solutions may require a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The set of commands used to solve a mathematical problem on a computer is the program or code. \n",
    "    - The code is generic, whereas a model is comprised of boundary and initial conditions, a computational grid, material properties on that grid, and forcing terms. \n",
    "    - Thus a model is **both** the data and code, whereas the code alone is just a tool waiting for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another kind of model is a statistical (or data model) model that relates observations to excitations without necessarily attempting to relate underlying physics of the problem (Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Regression Trees, Support Vector Machines are these kind of models). \n",
    "\n",
    "All the kinds of models are useful and appropriate tools in their various applications."

    "### Why Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several good reasons to model, and many poor reasons. \n",
    "- Most modeling efforts are attempts to predict the consequences of a proposed design or operation strategy. \n",
    "- Models can also be used to interpret system dynamics or as a framework for organizing data. \n",
    "- Models can also be used to study processes in generic settings. Generic models are useful in formulating regulatory guidelines and as screening tools to identify suitable or unsuitable designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three modeling applications are fundamentally different -- even though they use the same toolkits. \n",

    "- Models should not be expected to “prove\" anything -- a computer model cannot prove anything.\n",
    "- Models are useful to identify poor solutions to a problem, but rarely can they identify best solutions.\n",
    "- Models can be used to evaluate alternative designs (and this task is a good use of a model). \n",

    "\n",
    "The principle of parsimony is fundamental in engineering modeling. A model should only be as complex as necessary to answer the questions asked of it. All other things being equal a simpler model (fewer parameters) is preferred to a complicated model. This principle is sometimes referred to as Occam's razor."

    "### A Modeling Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward modeling protocol can be modeled on the classic \"Scientific Method\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. List the questions that need to be answered -- this step is crucial, it is the problem statement.\n",
    "2. List the available and necessary data to answer the questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the data do not exist, that fact should also be noted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assuming a model is the best tool, list the physical principles that need to be preserved in a model.\n",
    "4. Develop and test an `algorithm` to simulate the physical principles. In many cases, a professional program will be the tool of choice, although sometimes a “roll-your-own” approach makes better sense. \n",
    "    - Prior to actually solving the problem in question, develop and test simple problems to which you know the answer. This exercise develops the modelers skill and builds confidence in the tool.\n",
    "5. Apply the model working from a simple, known solution towards the problem to which you seek the actual solution. \n",
    "    - This step requires keeping a “simulation log.\" In this log, file names should be recorded \u000b",
    "(input files should change name each new run  -- record in the log the general nature of each simulation, the output, and the modelers interpretation for each new run)\n",
    "6. When the real problem is run construct professional exhibits (graphs, tables, etc.) for inclusion in the modeling report. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pages of output may be meaningful, but are not sufficient for a professional document.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Build the modeling report, including the methods used, inputs and assumptions, outputs (results) and their interpretation in the context of the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anderson and Woessner (1992), pages 2 - 10, is an excellent discussion of modeling philosophy and protocol. Their book is also aimed at porous \n",
    "flow modeling, but again the concepts are generic. The reader will find these notes borrow (nearly verbatim!) from this reference source."
