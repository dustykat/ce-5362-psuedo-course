    "### Additional Platforms for Python \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Anaconda platform (https://www.anaconda.com/): Anaconda distribution is an open-source Data Science Distribution Development Platform.  It includes Python 3 with over 1,500 data science packages making it easy to manage libraries and dependencies.  Available in Linux (x86-64 only), Windows, and Mac OS X.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Jupyter (https://jupyter.org/): JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is flexible: Configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. `note` Anaconda for MacOS includes a JupyterLab instance, so a separate install is not required.\n",

    "#### Additional Modules\n",
    "3. Math module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html): Gives access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard e.g. factorial, gcd, exponential, logarithm. \n",
    "4. Operator module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html): Helps in exporting a set of efficient functions corresponding to the intrinsic operators of Python.  For example, the operator add(x,y) is equivalent to the expression x+y.\n",
    "5. Scipy module (https://www.scipy.org/): A Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. Some of the core packages are:\n",
    "    * Numpy: Provides n-dimensional array package\n",
    "    * Scipy: Fundamental for scientific computing (e.g. linear algorithm, optimization)\n",
    "    * Matplotlib: Visualizations/2D plotting\n",
    "    * IPython: Enhanced interactive console <<= this is the kernel used in JupyterLab\n",
    "    * Pandas: Data structures and data analysis\n",

    "Academic integrity is taking responsibility for one’s own class and/or course work, being individually accountable, and demonstrating intellectual honesty and ethical behavior.  Academic integrity is a personal choice to abide by the standards of intellectual honesty and responsibility.  Because education is a shared effort to achieve learning through the exchange of ideas, students, faculty, and staff have the collective responsibility to build mutual trust and respect.  Ethical behavior and independent thought are essential for the highest level of academic achievement, which then must be measured.  Academic achievement includes scholarship, teaching, and learning, all of which are shared endeavors.  Grades are a device used to quantify the successful accumulation of knowledge through learning.  Adhering to the standards of academic integrity ensures grades are earned honestly.  Academic integrity is the foundation upon which students, faculty, and staff build their educational and professional careers.

A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should make that intention known to the instructor prior to the absence.  A student who is absent from classes for the observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence.  A student who is excused may not be penalized for the absence; however, the instructor may respond appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment satisfactorily.\n",
