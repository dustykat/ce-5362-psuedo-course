\section{Server-Side Computation --- A step towards automated process control}
This is a special chapter to show one (of several) way to use HTML, PHP, and \textbf{R} to build server-side computation devices.
The advantage of server-side processing is that maintaining the computation engine can be simplified because there is only one build (or the engine) in existence.
