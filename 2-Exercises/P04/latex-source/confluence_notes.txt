Elevations just upstream of confluence
White Oak = - 6.71 ft
Buffalo Bayou = -9.31 ft
Elevation just downstream of confluence
Buffalo Bayou = -14.28 ft

Confluence dimension at low flow (2000CFS)

80 feet across Buffalo Bayou,  Roughly 120 feet across White Oak.

First Approximation:

Set junction elevation at -10.1 feet.  Let interpolator handle connection.


Angle between WHite Oak and Buffalo downstream is 38-degrees
Angle between White Oak and Buffalo upstream is 70-degrees

Distance from junction to Buffalo Bayou Upstream cross section = 4087 feet.
Distance from junction to Buffalo bayou Downstream cross section = 4340 feet.
Distance from junction to White Oak Bayou upstream cross section = 6602 feet.

Cross Section Name -----  Low Elevation - Distance --- Delta Z
White Oak Upstream -----  -4.3 feet ------ 6602 feet -- (-4.3)-(-6.71) = 2.41 So=  0.03%
Buffalo Upstream ----- -11.52 feet ----- 4087 feet -- (-11.52)-(-9.31) =-2.21 So= -0.054% (adverse slope) 
Buffalo Downstream ---  -16.14 feet ---- 4340 feet -- (-14.28)-(-16.14)= 1.86 So=  0.042%
