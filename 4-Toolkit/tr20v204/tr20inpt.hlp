                                                                                    1  Y/N INPUT - *NO is default (CR) only, or (N + CR)                                          - Yes, requires (Y + CR).  Where (CR) = carriage return.                                                                                          2. If continuing input to a job, use path and name of original file.                                                                                            3. To verify input data is being written to a file, turn on attached               printer.                                                                                                                                                     4. HELP - - Additional help screens and these condensed notes can be               displayed by entering H from the Main Menu.  Help screens are then              selected from a Help Menu by pressing a desired letter + CR.                    Suggest reviewing these help screens first if:                                      ( You are an infrequent or first time user of this program.                     ( Unsure of order of TR-20 operations.                                          ( Interested in programs data entry and validation.                             ( Expect to review contents of the input file without exiting.                  ( Desire understanding of common problems.

Remember to run the completed input file through the TR-20 Data                 Check Program.                                                                                                                                               6  Keep CAPS LOCK on, (CAPS often required for Data Check & TR-20).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             PROGRAM PURPOSE - - This program will assist in developing an input             file for use with the TR-20 Version 2.0 microcomputer program.                                                                                                  In response to prompts, input data for TR-20 operations are entered             and inserted in proper data fields with limited data validation.  It            is assumed that the user has a working knowledge of the TR-20                   operation sequence, or is entering data from TR-20 worksheets                   filled out by someone who is knowledgeable.  For detailed input                 instructions, refer to the TR-20 User's manual, dated September 1991.                                                                                           MAIN MENU - - The main menu contains all TR-20 operations available             in the TR-20 program.  Operation code numbers in the menu are                   composed of the unique data codes and operation numbers that represent          TR-20 operations.  For example, selection of 61 from the menu will              trigger data prompts from the 6 RUNOFF 1 standard control operation.                                                                                            The actual spelling of the TR-20 operation names are used in the main           menu for consistency.  Other TR-20 operations without codes use the             first letter of their name.  The user can return easily to the main             menu for selection of the Help, Quit, and View input file functions.            The options to return to the main menu are explained under the QUIT             help screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    INPUT (DATA) FILE - - If the input file is to be written to the                 default (current) drive, the user specifies only the file name (ending          in .DAT).  If it is to be sent to another location, then the drive and          directory (path), and file name is used to store the input data.                                                                                                The program will display all existing file names, ending with .DAT in           the current drive and path.  If you wish to add new or revised                  operations to a file, use the old file name.  To create a new file,             use a new name, ending in .DAT.  Upon exiting the program, the file             is closed.                                                                                                                                                      An opportunity is provided to visually examine each record or groups            of similar records before they are entered into the file.  If you are           interrupted while entering data and wish to see what has been input             to the file, the option V of the main menu allows viewing of the                contents of the file without exiting the program.  The printer option,          if turned on, provides a continuous monitor of the file.                                                                                                        Records are added into the file in the order they are entered.  A               standard editor outside of this program is required to reorder file             records.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ORDER OF INPUT - - The order of operations is determined by user                selections from the main menu.  The sequence explained in the User's            Manual (see Section 3-3, Input Data Sequence) should be followed for            successful TR-20 runs.  In general, the job sequence is:                                                                                                           JOB and TITLE(S)                                                                Tabular Data                                                                    Standard Control (ENDATA is always last)                                        Executive Control for initial storm passes (first alternate)                        Modified tabular Data (replacement tables)                                      Modified Standard Control (replacement Standard Control)                        Executive Control for next alternate run                                        (Repeat above three as needed for additional alternates)                    ENDJOB (follows last Executive Control)                                         Intermediate Peaks (followed by another ENDJOB)                                                                                                              No checks are made on the total allowable number of standard control            operations (600), storms (10), and alternates (99).                                                                                                                                                                                             DATA ENTRY - - To leave blank or skip a data field in a TR-20                   operation, press the carriage return (CR) only at the prompt.  Any              data entered in a field may be changed prior to hitting the CR.  Once           placed in memory by the CR, it can only be changed by re-entering the           entire line(s) of data or by using a separate editing program after             exiting the program.                                                                                                                                            TABLE INPUT - - Table operation codes in the main menu provide prompts          for the complete table consisting of the table header(s), the table             data, and the end table.  The body of the table will allow up to the            maximum number of data lines allowed by TR-20.                                                                                                                  Data in the XSECTN and STRUCT tables columns is required to be in               order of increasing values.  Each value is checked when entered with            a carriage return (CR).  If not increasing, it must be changed                  immediately before proceeding.  To change the data line, complete the           line with temporary large values if needed, and after the beep, press           the CR while in data field number one.  You will then be asked if the           table lines are okay, and if not, what line(s) you wish to redo.  When          the table data entry is finished, press CR while in data field number           one.  You can then make line corrections before sending the table to            the input file.  Once in the input file, a separate editing program is          needed to revise the table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     DECIMALS - - The TR-20 program requires decimals in all non-integer             data fields.  The input program automatically places the decimal in             data fields after all whole numbers greater than one and before all             decimal numbers less than one.  For example, numbers "22, 1.05, and             008" will be entered in the input file as "22., 1.05, and .008".                Prompts marked with a double asterisk (**) will insert a decimal if             not entered.                                                                                                                                                    COMMON PROBLEMS - - The most common problems in data entry are:                   (1) When keys are inadvertently hit while the program or user                       expects another type of response,                                           (2) In skipping prompts, extra carriage returns (CR) may advance                    the programs beyond a critical response and may return to the                   menu with or without saving current screen data,                            (3) Turning the CAPS LOCK off can cause problems and unexpected                     results on some computer systems, and                                       (4) When printing lines, be sure the printer is on or the program                   will hang and may abort.                                                                                                                                  To prevent many of these types of problems, questions and responses             are designed to give the user time to evaluate or redo input data               before it is saved to the input file.                                                                                                                                                                                                           Y/N QUESTIONS - - The question " Return to Menu - Y/N ? " at the start          of a TR-20 operation requires a Y(es) response plus a (CR) to return            to the Main Menu.  Any other response will start the prompts for data           entry.  Once the prompts start, the only way to return to the Main              Menu without adding to the input file is to press carriage returns              until the end of the operation.                                                                                                                                 The question " Line OK - Y/N ?  " , " Do you wish to end the table              - Y/N ?  " or just " Y/N ?  " follows the data entry for each TR-20             operation.  The questions require a Y(es) response plus a (CR) to               write the data to the input file.  This assures time to review the              data before the input file is permanently updated.  If other than,              (Y+ CR) is entered the program will return to the start of the                  operation, or in a table a prompt will ask what line needs to be                corrected, and the data will need to be re-entered.  Errors once                entered in the input file can only be corrected with a separate                 editing program after the input file is run through the data check              program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        PRINTER - - Records written to the input file are simultaneously sent           to an attached printer if the "PRINTER ON" question is answered Y(es).          This provides a current list of the accepted operations for ready               reference.  The sound of the printer will also verify the records are           being written to the input file.  If the printer is inadvertently               turned off, the program will not respond to the line OK questions and           may cause a system error.                                                                                                                                       VIEW INPUT FILE - - To review the contents of the input file, enter V           from the Main Menu.  It will clear the screen and display the data              written to the file.  The input file can be paged down as desired.              To return to the Main Menu, press R.  To see a previous page requires           returning to the Main Menu and re-entering V.                                                                                                                                                                                                   QUIT - - To return to the DOS system, enter Q from the Main Menu.               All data written to the input file will be saved and the file closed.                                                                                           Ample opportunity exists to return to the menu.  The program returns            at the completion of each selected operation.  In addition, the                 question (return to menu - Y/N ?) at the beginning of each operation            allows returning to menu by pressing Y + CR.                                                                                                                    DATA CHECKS - - The input file created by this program is the input             to the 09/83(.2) PC and 09/01/83 mainframe TR-20 data check programs.           This input program only provides for limited data validation.  It               will only insert data in proper fields, enter decimals where needed,            require some numeric only responses, check permissible data ranges,             and check for increasing values in the cross section and structure              data tables.                                                                                                                                                    Use of the data check program is strongly recommended for additional            validation including some important logic checks.  NOTE: Be sure to             edit in CAPS as both the Data Check and TR-20 programs require caps             in most places.
