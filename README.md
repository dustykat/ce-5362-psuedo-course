CE 5362 SW modeling course - install in webroot

This repository contains course materials for CE 5362 SW modeling course.  
The repo is designed to be installed on a web server just above the FQDN webroot (or wherever you want to make the symlink).  

I use Apache but it will probably work as well or better on NGINX

## Notes:

1. `3-Readings` may contain copyright materials, so this directory should be protected (.htaccess should be secure enough to fit in fair use)
2.  Many of the notes do not have complete citations; very little of my work is original, so as the content matures the notes will eventually have complete, proper, citations.
